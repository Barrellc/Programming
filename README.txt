Within our programs, each of the files will run correctly.

We have structured our code to have segmented regions that calculate certain parts
of the code, this makes it clearer to read and follow. To further enhance this we
add comments above the code to explain what is happening.

Throughout the code we take advantage of functions, these allow for the code to be
maintained and edited more easily, we also made use of arrays throughout, again to
make the code more maintainable and easier to follow with the appropriate names
instead of the numbers as this can be very confusing.

Important Mentions:
Throughout the process of completing the coursework, we believe that we have worked
very well together considering the variety of skill within our group. At the start
of the coursework, we had a meeting to discuss our ability and therefore, who would
be able to do what.

An example of this would be question 1. Henry started the first question, the rest of
the group helped him finish the question and then we all worked together to complete
the code.



Missing Parts of the code:
Within question 2, there is no code that sorts the different speeds. The code does
output the values in the correct order, but does not sort it. We reordered the
array to let the values be outputted in an ordered manor.
